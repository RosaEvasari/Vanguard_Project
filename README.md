# Vanguard Project

## Project Overview
---
The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard is US-based investment management company. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was: **Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?**

Vanguard just launched an exciting digital experiment. Our goal as Customer Experience team is helping the company to uncover the results of the experiment.
